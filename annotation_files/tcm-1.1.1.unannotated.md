So—aiming to raise up the Earth itself, mired in the murk of dispair, the all-compassionate sage invented *Philosophy*, most revered among the eighteen spheres of learning. With this in mind, and to stimulate thoughtful readers, he began his *Formulae* with the words: "the path to the ultimate good lies in understanding the sixteen principles, starting with our evidential instruments". And, because, among these principles, it is upon the instruments that all the rest depend; this is what we will now discuss.

~

But—it is not correct that the intellectual practice proceeding from an analysis of our evidential instruments is necessarily connected to the attainment of the highest good. For, it is not possible to analyse the instruments, in the first place. This, after all, depends on an analysis of evidentiality; and the latter—as we will demonstrate—cannot be accomplished either from a constitutivist or nonconstitutivist standpoint.

~

On the other hand—why even bother knowing about evidentiality? Rational activity does not actually depend on this. All that matters, when embarking on some potentially expensive course of action, is knowledge about facts. And, you cannot respond that when some P is such that doubt that P or knowledge that not P is a negative condition on some action A, then knowledge that P is a reason for A, like knowledge of entailment is a reason for inferring. For, when there is doubt about evidentiality, it is because of the resulting doubt regarding the evidenced fact that there is no corresponding action. So, the former is not the negative condition, here.

~

No—because when we do face doubt about our evidence; then, knowledge that such as such really is the case, which is a precondition for confident action, does depend on knowledge of evidentiality.

~

Then—let us take establishing this to be constitutive.

~

Here are our options:

The evidentiality of some cognition

1. is detected by a truth detecting, nonevidentiality nondetecting mental state
— Yes or No?

2. is detected by a cognition that comes from a cognition whose content is the original cognition
— Yes or No?

Because although, in a nonconstitutivist account, evidentiality detection requires the detecting cognition to be observed; in a constitutivist account, the cognition only needs to be evidential.

3. is detected by its own substrate's detector
— Yes or No?

4. is just detected by its own substrate
— Yes or No? 
— does this apply in every case?

~

First, you must concede that in at least some cases, such as observations stemming from yogic intuition or our mental connection to universals, we find instances of mental states detecting their own evidentiality. Or else, you must qualify your assertion with the phrase "not caused by yogic intuition, etc."

~

No—because some people don't accept that these things exist.

~

And even if such things were accepted—since the claim is about detecting evidentiality, as such, and about whether evidentiality can be detected by its own substrate, across the board; you cannot consider this to be even a partial concession.

~

So, then—is it or is it not the case that the evidentiality of the cognition 'this is a pot' is detected by that very mental state? Is it or is it not the case that it is detected by just its own detector?

~

Now, whether the evidentiality of a cognition is defined as the property of

1. not presenting a subject nonpredicating property, or
2. detecting something undetected, or

or, under a universal correspondence thesis for mental states, and where first-order experience is not considered a natural kind:

3. being non-recollective awareness, or
4. being a structured mental state

it is not detected either by that cognition, itself, or by a perceptual state introspecting it. For, without awareness of the property "not having as its mode...", etc.; one cannot be aware that a mental state possesses it.

Nor, under anti-perceptualism about introspection, can a cognition's evidentiality be detected via an inference from cognitivity; for the property 'being cognized', on its own, is uncorrelated with properties like "being evident". Nor does it work to modify the inference to 'being observed in a manner conducive to evidence'; since, such a property cannot be observed. Otherwise, even the detection of nonevidentiality would be constitutive, via an inference from 'not being observed in a manner conducive to evidence'. 

~

Except—given some property P, either evidentiality is defined as

1. the property of being a P-presenting cognition of a P-substrate, or
2. the property of being a P-predicating cognition of a P-substrate

For, only from such a belief can there be confident action. This is the economical account and anything else introduces complications. And this, moreover, can be detected by the introspecting mental state. So, whether by an inner sense, an inference, or reflexive awareness; introspection detects as the content of a mental state both that an object is the substrate of some property and that that object is presented under that property.

Mental states are indexed by their content. So, the content of a first order mental state is present in the introspecting state. This being the case, when a mental state is experienced, in addition to an object T and a property P, the predication by P of T also features as its content. For, the latter is just as much a part of what defines the structure of that mental state. Since the form of a relatum in awareness is modulated by the relation it partakes in, the introspecting state is indexed by not just the relata, but the relation as well. In other words, the content of an awareness of, e.g., 'this object in front of me' appears in introspection as modulated by, e.g., 'being silver'. Otherwise, introspection would take the form, 'I am aware of this object in front of me *and* silver'. Not, 'I am aware of this object in front of me *as* silver'.

~

If this were the case, then nonevidential states would also be detected as being evidential; since the introspecting state would have for its content predication by a property which is the content of an error. Nor could you respond that since evidentiality is not known at the onset, it could not be reproduced in the introspecting state. After all, because the evidentiality of a cognition is detected by the mental state detecting that cognition; it is observed in introspection—like with awareness of an absence, where both the absence and the absentee are presented.

~

The nonevidentiality of a P-presenting cognition of a P-nonsubstrate is cognized nonconstitutively. Since, so long as the error is not made explicit, that the object lacks that property is not the content of the introspecting cognition. Nor should you say that insofar as the content of introspection includes the full content of the introspected cognition, there would be a conflation of the cognition presenting that error with the error itself.  After all, so long as no defeater appears, this is precisely what we expect. But, when we do encounter a defeater, the conflation is blocked; because, the importation of the error from the introspected cognition ceases. This is also why there is no error when observing someone else's mistake. 

~

And if you respond:

Truth is not just a matter of predicating one thing of another. Rather, it is a peculiar property of cognitive content which, though appearing in the first-order cognition, does not appear in introspection due the mental organ's lacking independent access to external objects.

~

No—because, inosfar as it, too, is a part of the content of the first-order cognition; this "peculiar property of cognitive content" would be imported into the introspecting state, just like the subject and predicate. Moreover, we have reason to doubt the existance of such a property of cogntive content.

~

We respond in the same vein to:

1. Assuming no reflexive awareness: the detection of evidentiality cannot be constitutive because a property cannot be detected without detecting its substrate. Detecting on the basis of its structure that a mental state is auditory, olfactory, etc. does not mean there is awareness of it as evidential. 

2. Assuming reflexive awareness: insofar as a cognition only observes itself, it lacks the capacity to detect its properties. Or, if it does have this capacity; nonevidentiality would also be detected constitutively.

3. Assuming non-reflexive introspection: the introspecting cognition, whether inferential or perceptual, cannot detect evidentiality as exclusive of error, because of a lack of correlation. That is—if it was detected only where it was present, then the detection of nonevidentiality would also be constitutive. Moreover, neither inference nor an inner sense are causaly connected to such content.

~

So, evidentiality is defined either as

1. the property of being a P-presenting cognition of a P-substrate, or
2. the property of being a P-predicating cognition of a P-substrate

because this is what is detected by introspection, whether understood as reflexive awareness, inner sense, or inference. That is, because the introspecting mental state detects of a cognition that it is P-presenting and that it has T-content. 

~

Moreover, if detection of evidentiality was nonconstitutive; then, with respect to the evidentiality detector; knowledge of its content—including awareness of the relevent inferential sign, target, and entailment relation—would, in turn, depend on detecting *it's* evidentiality. And, insofar as this too would proceed nonconstitutively, it would trigger a regress in the direction of both process and result. If this were so, we could not detect evidentiality at all. As such, we can also prove by contradiction that detection of evidentiality is constitutive.
