# Translations of the Sanskrit text on the homepage


#### Taittirīya upaniṣad, Śīkṣāvallī, Anuvāka 11, line 3:

<div>
svādhyāyān mā pramadaḥ ॥ tai।śī।11।3 
</div>
{: .quote}


The Taittirīya is one of the ten canonical upaniṣads. It's divided into 3 books (Śīkṣāvallī, Brahmānandavallī, and Bhr̥guvallī). 

The Śīkṣāvalli, as the name suggests, is a reflection on education and pedagogy. The 11th and penultimate Anuvāka [chapter] records an ancient commencement speech, where the teacher gives their last lecture before releasing their students out into the world. 

The opening lines of this speech go like this:

<div>
सत्यं वद । धर्मं चर ॥ स्वाध्यायान्मा प्रमदः ॥ <br>
satyaṁ vada । dharmaṁ cara । svādhyāyān mā pramadaḥ ॥ <br> <br>

Speak truth. Do right. Never stop learning.

#### Taittirīya upaniṣad, Bhr̥guvallī, Śāntimantram

<div>
ॐ सह नाववतु । सह नौ भुनक्तु । सह वीर्यं करवावहै । <br>
तेजस्विनावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै । ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥ <br> <br>

ōṁ saha nāv avatu । saha nau bhunaktu । saha vīryaṁ karavāvahai । <br>
tejasvinām adhītam astu mā vidviṣāvahai ॥ ōṁ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ ॥
</div>
{: .quote}


In the style typical of upaniṣads, each book of the Taittirīya begins with a peace invokation [शान्तिमन्त्रम्; śāntimantram]. The invokation, above, is from the Bhr̥guvallī and it's traditional to start one's study by reciting this verse. This website is about self-study; but, the verse makes reference to a classroom setting. The expression "us" refers to the teacher and student. 

The translation is as follows:

<div>
Ōṁ, may it protect us both. Let us be joyful. Let us be bold. <br>
Let us do glorious things together. May there be no hate between us. <br>
Ōm, peace, peace, peace.
</div>

#### Bodhicaryāvataraḥ Verse 2

<div>
न हि किञ्चिदपूर्वमत्र वाच्यं <br>
&emsp; न च संग्रन्थनकौशलं ममास्ति । <br>
अत एव न मे परार्थचिन्ता <br>
&emsp; स्वमनो वासयितुं कृतं मयेदम् ॥ बोधिचर्यावतरः।१।२
</div>

The Bodhicaryāvataraḥ by the buddhist philosopher Śāntideva is a classic. A sort of mix between a philosophical treatise and a guided meditation, a proper introduction to this work is more than what I can manage here. The text begins with an invocation to the Buddha (as is traditional in such texts), and then launches into the above verse. The translation is as follows:

<div>
There is nothing here that hasn't been said before. <br>
Nor, do I have any particular skill with composition. <br>
So, I have no ambitions to help anyone else. <br>
I'm writing this just to perfume my own mind.
