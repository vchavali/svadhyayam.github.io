# Introduction

This is the first entry in my attempt at an annotated translation of Gaṅgēśa's Tattvacintāmaṇi. In this post, I will translate and discuss the section I, chapter I of the first volume, *Perception* [Pratyakṣakhaṇḍaḥ]. In other words, I'm skipping the preamble, *A Theory of Good Beginnings* [Maṅgalavādaḥ], and starting with the *Prior Position* [Pūrvapakṣaḥ] section of the chapter *Detecting Evidentiality* [Prāmāṇyajñaptivādaḥ].

My aim is to create something like a self-study guide as a way for me to process what I'm reading. But, I also hope it will help anyone else wanting to study this work. My source text is the 1973 Tirupati edition (pub. Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, ed. N.S. Ramanuja Tatacharya). I am reading the text along with the *Prakāśa* and *Nyāyaśikhāmaṇi* commentaries; by Rucidattamiśra and Rāmakr̥ṣṇādhvarin, respectively. I also make use of Stephen Phillips' english translation and commentary. Fair warning: these notes reflect my own limited understanding of the material and I can't claim either completeness or accuracy. Also, much of the commentarial discussions go over my head.

# Prāmāṇyajñaptivādaḥ | Detecting Evidentiality

## Translation

So—aiming to raise up the Earth itself, mired in the murk of dispair, the all-compassionate sage invented *Philosophy*, most revered among the eighteen spheres of learning. With this in mind, and to stimulate thoughtful readers, he began his *Formulae* with the words: "the path to the ultimate good lies in understanding the sixteen principles, starting with our evidential instruments". And, because, among these principles, it is upon the instruments that all the rest depend; this is what we will now discuss.

## Comments

The "all-compassionate sage" is Gautama Akṣapāda, the author of *The Philosophical Formulae* (Nyāya-sūtrāṇi), the ancient text that birthed the *Old Philosophy* (prācīnanyāyaḥ)—that is, "Nyāya" with a capital "N".

The phrase "evidential instrument" is how I'm translating the important technical term, "pramāṇam". An evidential instrument is anything we use to make observations about the world and which lends "evidentiality" (prāmāṇyam) to those observations. "Evidentiality" is the property of an observation in virtue of which beliefs or actions stemming from it count as rational. In other words, evidential observations justify beliefs and actions. For example, if we look up at the sky and make an observation that it's blue; then, our visual apparatus is the evidential instrument responsible for that observation.

As an aside, going forward I'm going to deviate in a variety of ways from how we see certain key terms typically rendered in the english language secondary literature on sanskrit epsitemology; especially "pramāṇam" (evidential instrument), "pramā" (evident), and "niścayaḥ" (belief). I don't want to belabor this too much. But, I hope that the success or failure of the following translation and analysis of the Tattvacintāmaṇi will stand for itself as an argument for or against these interpretive choices.

## Translation

But—it is not correct that the intellectual practice proceeding from an analysis of our evidential instruments is necessarily connected to the attainment of the highest good. For, it is not possible to analyse the instruments, in the first place. This, after all, depends on an analysis of evidentiality; and the latter—as we will demonstrate—cannot be accomplished either from a constitutivist or nonconstitutivist standpoint.

## Notes

The word "but" (nanu) introduces an objection. What follows is in the voice of an imagined opponent (pūrvapakṣin), whom commentators identify as a mādhyamaka buddhist. The response, which will come next, is not precisely in Gaṅgēśa's "own perspective" (svapakṣa) either; but, initiates an elaborate multi-polar debate featuring a variety of different voices—each taking a distinct stance within the available argumentative terrain. 

So far, though, we have no explicit argument. An argument is alluded to with the words "as we will demonstrate, shortly". But, this never actually comes up, explicitly. Instead, the argument is implicit in the whole formulation of the chapter and the sorts of issues and problems that are about to be discussed. Each problem that Gaṅgēśa discusses, here on, represents a potentially existential challenge to the discipline of epistemology. 

Quick note on "constitutivism". This is in reference to a family of theories that are collected under the heading "evidential constitutivism" (svataḥ-pramāṇya-vādaḥ). The constitutivists hold that the evidentiality of an observation is a function of it's content rather than, e.g., its causal history. If this sounds too vague and/or abstract, don't worry. This is *the* central topic of the first couple chapters of the Tattvacintāmani, and we will get into positively gory detail about it, very soon.

## Translation

On the other hand—why even bother knowing about evidentiality? Rational activity does not actually depend on this. All that matters, when embarking on some potentially expensive course of action, is knowledge about facts. 

Nor can you respond that when some P is such that doubt that P or knowledge that not P is a negative condition on some action A, then knowledge that P is a reason for A, like knowledge of pervasion is a reason for inferring. When there is doubt about evidentiality, it is because of the resulting doubt regarding the evidenced fact that there is no corresponding action. So, the former is not the negative condition, here.

## Notes

This is challenge #2. The worry is that a theory of the evidential instruments plays no role either in understanding rationality or in acting rationally in the world: When engaging in activity, particularly complex and involved activity, in order to be successful we need to have accurate beliefs about the world. But, it doesn't follow from this that we need to know that are beliefs are accurate.

In Western epistemological terms, this is an externalist perspective on justification. So long as our epistemic faculties—our senses, our cognitive faculties, etc.—are working; whether or not we know that they're working doesn't matter. We don't need to have insight into why we believe something to be a certain way. In order to be warranted in believing something, all that matters is that our belief relates to its object in the right sort of way.

But—if all that matters is that our epistemic faculties are functioning, and it doesn't matter whether we have insight into how or why they work; then, there's no role for epistemology in a theory of rationality. At most, we might need science—like optholmology or psychiatry—to diagnose when things go wrong. But we don't need to study these things *philosophically*; since epistemological questions have no bearing on our acquiring knowledge or acting in the world. 

## Translation

No—because when we do face doubt about our evidence; then, knowledge that such as such really is the case, which is a precondition for confident action, does depend on knowledge of evidentiality.

## Notes

This, at last, is Gaṅgēśa speaking in his own voice. 

The issue is that this sort of externalism seems to leave no role for asking about our reasons for believing something as part of evaluating whether or not we are acting rationally.

Gaṅgēśa's response is that, when our epistemic faculties are in doubt, however; reflecting on and being able to offer reasons for why we believe what we believe is unavoidable. Doubt about the evidentiality of our observations, independently of doubt about their content, is a blocker of belief and action. And such doubt can only be answered by offering explicit justification. Otherwise, we lose the right to form a belief based on our observation—even if that observation is accurate, in fact. The bottom line here is that awareness of what justifies our beliefs is not optional. If someone challenges us, we can't just shrug as say "I just *know*".

## Translation

Then—let us take establishing this to be constitutive.

## Notes

Ok, let's say we accept that we do need to be able to evaluate the evidentiality of our observations. How would we even go about doing this? The constitutivist says that to determine the evidentiality of an observation, you have to look to its *content*, not its origin.

## Translation

Here are our options:

The evidentiality of some cognition

1. is detected by a truth detecting, nonevidentiality nondetecting mental state
— Yes or No?

2. is detected by a cognition uncaused by a cognition with that cognition as content
— Yes or No?

Because although, in a nonconstitutivist account, evidentiality detection requires the detecting cognition to be observed; in a constitutivist account, the cognition only needs to be evidential.

3. is detected by its own substrate's detector
— Yes or No?

4. is just detected by its own substrate
— Yes or No? 
— does this apply in every case?

## Notes

Gaṅgēśa tries sussing out what exactly this "evidential constitutivism" means. He does so by setting out a set of claims accepting or rejecting which cleaves the space of theoretical possibilites in two. The claims are more-or-less independent of each other. So, together they give you something like coordinates to map out where different individual theories fall within this terrain—and to give us a broad sense of the landscape.

Claim (1) is the most important. It's a bit confusing, so let's break it down. 

First, saying that a mental state M *detects* some property P belonging to some entity E just means that when someone is in M then they are aware that E possesses P. So, saying 'M detects the evidentiality of E' means that if someone is in M; then they are aware that J is evidential. 'M detects the J's truth' means being in M entails being aware that E is true. M detects 'E's content' means being in M entail being aware that E has that content.

What claim (1) is saying is that detecting the evidentiality of E requires only that, in addition to thinking, correctly, that J is true, you must not think that it is not nonevidential. In non-technical terms, this just means that in order to being able to say that some observation is evidential (leaving aside the question of what it *means* to be evidential, for now), three things have to happen:

1 — it has to be true
2 — you have to think that it's true
3 — you should have no reason to doubt it

An example might make things clearer. 

Say you believe that the sky is blue. Someone challenges you on that belief. So, you say that you know that sky is blue because you saw it being blue. Your observation of the sky being blue is your *evidence* for believing that it's blue. But, now let's say that same person asks you, how do you know that your observation is evidence? The constitutivists answer to this is that as long as the observation *is* true, you *think* its true, and you don't have any evidence for doubting it. Then, you don't need additional positive evidence for believing in the evidentiality of your evidence. Evidentiality comes for free. Being evidential is just a part of what making an observation *is*. That's what it means to say that it is *constitutive*. 

Claims (2)-(3) are not fully independent but actually represent three different answers to a single question.

## Translation

First, you must concede that in at least some cases, such as observations stemming from yogic intuition or our mental connection to universals, we find instances of mental states detecting their own evidentiality. Or else, you must qualify your assertion with the phrase "not caused by yogic intuition, etc."

## Notes

## Translation

No—because some people don't accept that these things exist.

## Notes

Not everyone agrees that there are such things as yogic intuition and mental connections to universals. So, you can't use them as counter-examples in general discussions.

## Translation

And even if such things were accepted—since the claim is about detecting evidentiality, as such, and about whether evidentiality can be detected by its own substrate, across the board; you cannot consider this to be even a partial concession.

## Notes

## Translation

So, then—is it or is it not the case that the evidentiality of the cognition 'this is a pot' is detected by that very mental state? Is it or is it not the case that it is detected by just its own detector?

## Notes

As far as I can tell, this is just a restatement of earlier claims with a specific example. Commentaries, like the *Prakāśa* list it as a fifth item in the list. But, the *Prakāśa*, at least, makes no real comment about why its listed separately. In fact, neither the *Prakāśa* nor the *Nyāyaśikhāmaṇi* make any comment on it at all.

## Translation

Now, whether the evidentiality of a cognition is defined as the property of

1. not presenting a subject nonpredicating property, or
2. detecting something undetected, or

or, under a universal correspondence thesis for mental states, and where first-order experience is not considered a natural kind:

3. being non-recollective awareness, or
4. being a structured mental state

it is not detected either by that cognition, itself, or by a perceptual state introspecting it. For, without awareness of the property "not having as its mode...", etc.; one cannot be aware that a mental state possesses it.

Nor, under anti-perceptualism about introspection, can a cognition's evidentiality be detected via an inference from cognitivity; for the property 'being cognized', on its own, is uncorrelated with properties like "being evident". Nor does it work to modify the inference to 'being observed in a manner conducive to evidence'; since, such a property cannot be observed. Otherwise, even the detection of nonevidentiality would be constitutive, via an inference from 'not being observed in a manner conducive to evidence'. 

## Notes

The "now" signals a change in voice and introduces an objection. The speaker is a nonconstitutivist, but not one that represents Gaṅgēśa's own perspective. 

Recall that the constitutivist position is that the evidentiality of an evidential state is a function of its content. The discussion begining with "now" and continuing on to nearly the end of this chapter is concerned with understanding what exactly the "content" of an evidential mental state is. This is worked out via a dialectical encounter between the constitutivist and a nonconstitutivist opponent. 

In the above passage, this opponent suggests what she takes to be a common-sense understanding of the content of a mental state as not being rich enough to determine its own evidentiality. The idea is this:

## Translation

Except—given some property P, either evidentiality is defined as

1. the property of being a P-presenting cognition of a P-substrate, or
2. the property of being a P-predicating cognition of a P-substrate

For, only from such a belief can there be confident action. This is the economical account and anything else introduces complications. And this, moreover, can be detected by the introspecting mental state. So, whether by an inner sense, an inference, or reflexive awareness; introspection detects as the content of a mental state both that an object is the substrate of some property and that that object is presented under that property.

Mental states are indexed by their content. So, the content of a first order mental state is present in the introspecting state. This being the case, when a mental state is experienced, in addition to an object T and a property P, the predication by P of T also features as its content. For, the latter is just as much a part of what defines the structure of that mental state. Since the form of a relatum in awareness is modulated by the relation it partakes in, the introspecting state is indexed by not just the relata, but the relation as well. In other words, the content of an awareness of, e.g., 'this object in front of me' appears in introspection as modulated by, e.g., 'being silver'. Otherwise, introspection would take the form, 'I am aware of this object in front of me *and* silver'. Not, 'I am aware of this object in front of me *as* silver'.

## Notes

## Translation

If this were the case, then nonevidential states would also be detected as being evidential; since the introspecting state would have for its content predication by a property which is the content of an error. Nor could you respond that since evidentiality is not known at the onset, it could not be reproduced in the introspecting state. After all, because the evidentiality of a cognition is detected by the mental state detecting that cognition; it is observed in introspection—like with awareness of an absence, where both the absence and the absentee are presented.

## Notes

## Translation

The nonevidentiality of a P-presenting cognition of a P-nonsubstrate is cognized nonconstitutively. Since, so long as the error is not made explicit, that the object lacks that property is not the content of the introspecting cognition. Nor should you say that insofar as the content of introspection includes the full content of the introspected cognition, there would be a conflation of the cognition presenting that error with the error itself.  After all, so long as no defeater appears, this is precisely what we expect. But, when we do encounter a defeater, the conflation is blocked; because, the importation of the error from the introspected cognition ceases. This is also why there is no error when observing someone else's mistake. 

## Notes

"This is also why there is no error when observing someone else's error"—in the case of observing someone else's error (unlike in the case of introspection), there is no importation of the propositional attitude (e.g. belief or doubt) from the introspected state, since this is specifically a feature of introspection. Because it's the attitude of belief coupled with awareness of some mistaken content, and not the awareness of the content on its own, which constitutes error; we are not automatically in error when merely observing someone else making a mistake. But, when observing our own error, unless we explicitly notice that we were mistaken, we reproduce that error in introspection.

## Translation

And if you respond:

Truth is not just a matter of predicating one thing of another. Rather, it is a peculiar property of cognitive content which, though appearing in the first-order cognition, does not appear in introspection due the mental organ's lacking independent access to external objects.

## Notes

"a peculiar property of cognitive content"—according to the Nyāyaśikhāmaṇi, there is debate about what exactly this means. Either this refers to a "a surplus property of cognitive content" [atirikta-viṣayatā] or "a property of the content of a unitary cognition" [samūhālambana-aviṣayo viśiṣṭajñāna-viṣaya-svarūpasaṁbandha-viśeṣaḥ]. I'm not entirely sure what the term "surplus" means, here; but my guess is that it means a property other than the generic kind property "being cognitive content" [viṣayatā]. A unitary cognition is just a cognition whose content represents a single proposition. Compare this to the perception of a whole scene which captures multiple propositions worth of content.

A cognition presenting some content is not the same thing as that content being true. Rather, truth is, itself, a property of cognitive content, distinct from the elements that constitute it. The precise nature of this property is not stated out-right here, since it is a matter of much contraversy. 

But, the point of the argument is this: introspection only detects the content of some cognition. I.E. it generates awareness that some cognition has such and such a content. Knowing that this content is "true" requires detecting something additional. For example, it requires knowing that this content corresponds to the actual objects the cognition is directed towards. But, because this involves knowledge of mind-external entities, it lies outside the purview of the introspective faculty. This being the case, if evidentiality requires that a cognition is true; introspection alone cannot detect this. So, detecting evidentiality is not constitutive of detecting cogntition. 

In simple terms—we need to know more than the content of a cognition in order to no that it is true. Since evidentiality depends on truth, it cannot just be a function of a cognition's content.

Put in terms of contemporary Western epistemology, knowledge is belief derived from evidence; where "evidence", in this context, implies both truth and justification (+/- some anti-luck condition). In other words, "evidence" is just a name for whatever additional thing belief needs in order for it be knowledge. This is more-or-less the same thing as a JTB+ account of knowledge.

Now, both the constituvists and the nonconstitutivists agree that having evidence means being in a mental state that has the capacity to deliver some information—i.e. deliver "evidence"—to a subject forming a belief. Let's use the word "observation" as a generic term for this type of evidence-delivering mental state. This includes "direct" observation, i.e. sense perception, as well as "indirect" forms of observation such as inference and testimony. The idea is that in order for an observation to be evidential, it has to obey certain conditions that are together bundled up into the word "evidentiality". The constituvist—nonconstitutivist debate is about what exactly this "evidentiality" amounts to.

More precisely, we can analyze this debate into separate epistemic, ontic, and conceptual problems of evidentiality. The first three chapters of the *Tattvacintāmaṇi*—titled "Detecting Evidentiality", "Grounding Evidentiality", and "Defining Evidentiality", respectively—each deal with one of these problems.

The epistemic constitutivists say that detecting evidentiality involves nothing more than detecting the observation that generated the belief in question; where "detecting an observation" entails a subject's being aware that they are/were in some mental state, indexed by some mental content. 

Take a simple example—let's say you have a belief that the sky is blue. For this belief to count as knowledge it must have come about because you had some evidence for it. Let's say you that you looked at the sky and saw that it was blue. Your evidence, in this case, is perception. Now, if someone asks you, "How do you know that the belief is true?"; the constitutivist answer to this is: "I know by introspection that I perceived the sky to be blue, which is the basis for my belief that the sky is blue". 

This brings us the argument above. Namely, the nonconstitutivist argues that introspection tells us what the content of our observation is; but doesn't tell us that it is true. Since truth is a condition for an observation's being evidential—otherwise, knoweldge would not be factive—introspection can't detect evidentiality, on its own.


## Translation

No—because, inosfar as it, too, is a part of the content of the first-order cognition; this "peculiar property of cognitive content" would be imported into the introspecting state, just like the subject and predicate. Moreover, we have reason to doubt the existance of such a property of cogntive content.

## Notes

"though appearing in first order cognition": why does the nonconstitutivist think that truth *is* apparent in the first order mental state but not in the introspecting state? 

## Translation

We respond in the same vein to:

## Notes

According to the *Prakāśa*, by "in the same vein", Gaṅgēśa is referring to all the arguments beginning with "cognition is indexed by its content", taken as a whole. 

We are nearing the end of this section. What follows is a brief summary of the unsuccessfull anti-constitutivist arguments covered in the chapter. After this, we will finally get to the "master-argument" for epistemic constitutivism.

## Translation

1. Assuming no reflexive awareness: the detection of evidentiality cannot be constitutive because a property cannot be detected without detecting its substrate. Detecting on the basis of its structure that a mental state is auditory, olfactory, etc. does not mean there is awareness of it as evidential. 

2. Assuming reflexive awareness: insofar as a cognition only observes itself, it lacks the capacity to detect its properties. Or, if it does have this capacity; nonevidentiality would also be detected constitutively.

3. Assuming non-reflexive introspection: the introspecting cognition, whether inferential or perceptual, cannot detect evidentiality as exclusive of error, because of a lack of correlation. That is—if it was detected only where it was present, then the detection of nonevidentiality would also be constitutive. Moreover, neither inference nor an inner sense are causaly connected to such content.

## Notes

This is the end-of-section review of the anti-constitutivist arguments discussed so far. The constitutivist responses are left as an exercise to the reader; but should be evident from the material covered in this section, starting with the line "cognition is indexed by its content". 

Next is a summary of the constitutivist thesis, followed by a master argument for epistemic constitutivism. This ends the section. The second, and last section, of chapter 1 presents Gaṅgēśa's version of the nonconstitutivist account, begining with what he takes to be the "real" problem with constitutivism.

## Translation

So, evidentiality is defined either as

1. the property of being a P-presenting cognition of a P-substrate, or
2. the property of being a P-predicating cognition of a P-substrate

because this is what is detected by introspection, whether understood as reflexive awareness, inner sense, or inference. That is, because the introspecting mental state detects of a cognition that it is P-presenting and that it has T-content. 

Moreover, if detection of evidentiality was nonconstitutive; then, with respect to the evidentiality detector; knowledge of its content—including awareness of the relevent inferential sign, target, and entailment relation—would, in turn, depend on detecting *it's* evidentiality. And, insofar as this too would proceed nonconstitutively, it would trigger a regress in the direction of both process and result. If this were so, we could not detect evidentiality at all. As such, we can also prove by contradiction that detection of evidentiality is constitutive.
