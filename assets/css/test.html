<p>This is in reference to a family of theories that are collected under the heading “evidential constitutivism” (svataḥ-pramāṇya-vādaḥ).</p>
<p>The constitutivists hold that the evidentiality of an observation is a function of it’s content rather than external factors like its causal history. In other words, whatever it is that makes an observation evidential is grounded in facts about its nature as a mental state; i.e., the sort of mental state that it is. According to a nonconstitutivist, on the other hand, evidentiality also depends on facts about the process by which an observation comes about.</p>
<p>Within this debate, we can distinguish between tan epistemic and a metaphysical question.</p>
<p>Consider, for example: Our evidence for believing that the sky is blue is that we looked up at the sky and saw that it was blue. The epistemic question is: how do we know that seeing that the sky is blue is evidence for believing that it is blue? The metaphysical question is: what is it about our seeing the sky being blue that makes it evidence for believing it to be blue?</p>
<p>The nonconstitutivist says, with respect to the first question: determining that seeing something is evidence for believing it depends on us knowing about how seeing works. In other words, it depends on us investigating the various physiologic and environmental factors that effect the performance of our visual faculties. The constitutivist, on the other hand, thinks that we can determine that seeing is evidence for believing just by introspecting on perceptual experience; i.e. by reflecting on what it is like to see something.</p>
<p>With respect to the second question, the nonconstitutivist says that the physiologic and environmental factors involved in vision are what make seeing a form of evidence. The constitutivist, on the other hand, says that the phenomenology of visual experience is what makes it evidential.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the TCM, titled <em>The Epistemology of Evidentiality</em> [Prāmānyajñaptivādaḥ], centers on the epistemic question. The second chapter, <em>The Metaphysics of Evidentiality</em> [Prāmānyotpattivādaḥ], deals with the metaphysical question.</p>
<p>The third chapter, <em>The Concept of Evidentiality</em> [prāmāṇyalakṣaṇavādaḥ], deals with conceptual problems associated with evidence. Questions dealt with in this chapter include: 
—Is the concept of evidence analyzable?
—If it is analyzably, what does it mean for something to be a form of evidence?
—If it isn’t analyzable, do evidential mental states form a natural kind?</p>

<p>The word “but” (nanu) introduces an objection. What follows is in the voice of an imagined opponent (pūrvapakṣin), whom commentators identify as a Mādhyamaka Buddhist. The response, which will come next, is not precisely in Gaṅgēśa’s “own perspective” (svapakṣa) either; but, initiates an elaborate multi-polar debate featuring a variety of different voices—each taking a distinct stance within the available argumentative terrain.</p>
